My name is **Yousef Albasel**, Iam a computer science student from Egypt interested in computer graphics, and AI. Pursuing my studies at Cairo University's Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence.

I started programming with web development, learning JavaScript frameworks, Django, and .NET development—but quickly realized this wasn’t my path. Turns out, I’m more of a low-level programming person. I like to dive deep into C and C++, reinventing the wheel pretty much every time. Some might call this self-inflicted suffering... and honestly, they might be right!

For fun, I started learning computer graphics. I wouldn’t say I’m great at it, but it’s been entertaining. The hardest part of my coding journey so far, hands down. I’ve put it on hold for now, but I’ll still post about it every once in a while.

Recently, I joined Samsung’s Innovation Campus for AI, where I got introduced to machine learning and deep learning—and, well, I’m hooked. Training deep learning models and seeing the results is something I’ve completely fallen for, so expect to see a lot of that here.

Currently, I’m a third-year computer science student, doing my best to stay sane. Wish me luck!
